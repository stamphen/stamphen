- Hi, I’m Adam and I'm currently a BYU student preparing for my mission. 
- I’m considering majoring in strategic management and minoring in both computer science and mathematics, but I'm not totally sure yet. 
- I love reading and being outside and would love to meet new people and learn as much as I can!
